<p><img src="/MarianneKnuth.jpg" alt="Marianne Knuth" width="243" height="210" id="left">I am a woman with roots on two continents, Africa and Europe. I am passionate about supporting people in coming together in more authentic and life-affirming ways than what is the norm in most of our dominant systems.</p>
<p>I am the co-founder of <a href="http://www.kufunda.org/">Kufunda Learning Village,</a> a centre dedicated to working with rural Zimbabweans as they discover their wealth and wisdom, for themselves, but also for people everywhere.</p>
<p>My journey and my passion is around learning to follow my own inner voice of wisdom, and in that finding  joy and flow. I look forward to many more women rising to their power, especially in Zimbabwe, to help shift this beautiful country out of its stuck and painful place.
