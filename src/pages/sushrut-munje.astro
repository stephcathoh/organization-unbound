<p>After a stint in an engineering college and a couple of internships, I&#39;ve found my calling as a writer and an entrepreneur. Based in Mumbai (India), I&#39;m building <a href="http://hammerandmop.com/">Hammer &amp; Mop</a>, a premium cleaning services company focused on providing beneficial employment to the underprivileged and delivering remarkable service to our clients.</p>
<p>I also curate <a href="http://frankaffe.com/">Frankaffe</a>, a group blog where I write with my co-authors. Frankaffe believes in freedom, love and the vast scope of design. I&#39;m a contributing author on <a href="http://under30ceo.com/">Under30CEO.com</a> and a published poet. It is my aim to address key workforce issues in India and create brilliant organizations that deliver value to all parties involved.</p>
<p>I enjoy having conversations that help expand perspectives. I&#39;m in love with efficiency and animals.</p>
