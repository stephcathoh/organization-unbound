<p>I am an education activist and comedian based in Cairo, Egypt. I have been fortunate to travel to many parts of the world, where my experiences and the people I have met have led me to seek a deeper understanding of the systemic roots of what is called ‘underdevelopment’.</p>
<p>In addition to my work exploring alternatives to schooling, I have recently been focused on food and farming, and on supporting responsible enterprise and simple everyday processes that can help anchor healthier, happier ways of living.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about people and about the stories that they tell, about what matters to them, theirs dreams and also their disappointments. It is precisely those stories that drive my work. I am now at a point in my life where I am trying to bring my work into more alignment with my own story, which is proving a lot harder and a lot more exciting than what I had expected.
