    <p><img src="/CarolineHoweheadshot.jpg" alt="Caroline Howe" width="137" height="166" id="left">I explore how to get more people excited about sustainability, through education, new technology, financial tools, and community engagement. I&#39;m particularly passionate about engaging young people in developing community-based solutions to environmental challenges. This has taken me to five continents, working with my start-up, <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/loopsolutionsindia/">Loop Solutions</a>, as well as with NGOs, youth groups, companies, UN agencies, and a ton of fantastic youth leaders.</p>
