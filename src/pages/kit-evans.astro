<p><img src="/KitEvans.jpg" alt="Kit Evans" title="Kit Evans" id="left">I am a third year Master of Divinity candidate at the <a href="http://www.psr.edu/">Pacific School of Religion</a> in Berkeley, California. My concentration is Women&#39;s Studies in Religion and Peace and Conflict Studies. Over the last 14 years I have used my education, teachings on nonviolence, travels, personal experiences, and relationship with God as a teacher and motivational speaker.  I hope to continue to assist women and young people working to heal from violence, abuse, and self esteem issues.</p>
