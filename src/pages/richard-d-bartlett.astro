<p>I am a software developer, activist, and open source hardware hacker.</p>

<p>I am one of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.loomio.org">Loomio</a>, an open source software for consensus decision-making, built by a worker-owned cooperative in New Zealand. We believe that more groups practicing effective, inclusive decision-making can change organisational dynamics at a global scale. Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.</p>
<p>I host <a href="https://blog.loomio.org/2017/03/13/were-coming-to-the-us-for-a-community-organising-workshop-tour/">training workshops</a> with organisations that want to be more collaborative and less hierarchical. I believe the most effective way to change a team culture is through gentle sustained pressure, so I also provide coaching services to people that want a buddy to check in with regularly.</p>
