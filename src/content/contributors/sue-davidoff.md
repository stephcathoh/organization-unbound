[![Sue](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sue-254x300.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sue.jpg)I am a facilitator, teacher, and writer. As co-founder of [The Proteus Initiative](http://www.proteusinitiative.org/), I help to bring a Goethean-inspired understanding and method to the sphere of social and environmental change, activism and stewardship.

Prior to that I was the founder and former director of the Teacher Inservice Project where I provided organizational development support to educational institutions at the local, provincial and national levels in South Africa.

I’m the author of, amongst other works, [The Learning School](http://www.amazon.com/The-Learning-School-Organisation-Development/dp/0702156620), [The Courage to Lead](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Books/s?ie=UTF8&field-author=Sue%20Davidoff&page=1&rh=n%3A266239%2Cp_27%3ASue%20Davidoff), and Changing your Teaching.
