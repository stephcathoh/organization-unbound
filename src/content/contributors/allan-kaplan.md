[![Allan](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Allan.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Allan.jpg)As co-founder of [The Proteus Initiative](http://www.proteusinitiative.org/), I strive to bring together a sensibility for, understanding of, and practice towards the relationship between ecological wholeness and social coherence and healing. Through a variety of mediums- writing, facilitation, consulting, teaching- I help people to stretch their processes of inner and outer development to greater edges and depths.

Prior to starting the Proteus Initiative, I founded and served as a former director of the [Community Development Resource Association](http://www.cdra.org.za/) in Cape Town, South Africa.

I’ve authored, amongst other works, [The Development Practitioner's Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Development-Practitioners-Handbook-Allan-Kaplan/dp/0745310214) and [Artists of the Invisible](http://www.amazon.com/Development-Practitioners-Social-Process-Invisible/dp/0745310184).
