[![CurtisOgden](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CurtisOgden-300x300.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CurtisOgden.jpg)I work at the [Interaction Institute for Social Change](http://interactioninstitute.org/) (IISC), a consulting practice that builds the capacity of organisations, communities and networks to engage in more effective, equitable and inclusive social change. I provide collaborative network building support to initiatives focused on racial/socio-economic equity and sustainability in education, public health and food systems around New England and the United States.

I am also a board member of the [New England Grassroots Environment Fund](http://grassrootsfund.org/).  Prior to joining IISC, I managed the [Building Excellent Schools Fellowship](http://buildingexcellentschools.org/start-a-school/) for aspiring urban charter school founders interested in addressing educational equity.

I grew up in Flint, a small town in Michigan, USA. As the son of two teachers, I had the benefit of living overseas at an early age, including Libreville, Gabon. After finishing university I returned to Africa to do community and youth development work in Zimbabwe through [Silveira House](http://www.jesuitszimbabwe.co.zw/index.php/what-we-do/silveira-house), where I was introduced to and deeply influenced by participatory action research and Training for Transformation methods.

I currently reside, garden, and play in western Massachusetts with my wife and three daughters.
