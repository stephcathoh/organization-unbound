[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Liam-249x300.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Liam.jpg)I help organisations to be more like people- to work together as we do when we don't have job titles, business plans and strategy documents telling us how to engage with one another around meaningful causes.

I have a background in social media, campaigning and organisational change, and have recently crowd-funded and self-published [Anarchists in the Boardroom: How social media and social movements can help your organisation to be more like people](http://www.morelikepeople.org/the-book/).

I like punk rock, hip-hop and tattoos, and am more approachable than my facial hair suggests.

I Tweet as [@hackofalltrades](https://twitter.com/hackofalltrades), blog at [morelikepeople.org](http://www.morelikepeople.org/), and curate the '[more like people](https://www.facebook.com/MoreLikePeople)' Facebook page. I can be reached directly at liam(at)morelikepeople.org
