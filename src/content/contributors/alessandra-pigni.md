![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Alessandra-Pigni.png)I am a humanitarian psychologist with several years of experience in the Middle East. After serving with [Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders](https://www.msf.org.za/) in Palestine and China, I decided to dedicate my work to understanding the connection between meaningful work and burnout. In 2014-15 I was an ELAC Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Oxford, which lead to the publication of my first book _[The Idealist’s Survival Kit. 75 Simple Ways to Avoid Burnout](https://www.amazon.com/Idealists-Survival-Kit-Prevent-Burnout/dp/1941529348)_. I’ve come to realize that changing the world is a much sexier idea than changing ourselves and our organisations. And that while aid workers need to practice self-care, it is up to their organisations to foster a healthy work environment, which is the real key to burnout prevention.

My home and "secure base" is in Oxford, UK where I live in a typical English terraced home, full of art, photos and memories from my beloved Palestine.  My passions are photography and hiking, and I particularly love walking on old pilgrimage routes. This year, I hiked 650 km on the Camino de Santiago in Northern Spain, and one of my dreams is to walk from Rome to Jerusalem. I'm not religious, but I find beauty and something sacred in walking, it's profoundly healing and it restores my faith in humanity. Chance encounters among "ramblers" often have a special quality.

Alessandra left this earth in December 2018.
