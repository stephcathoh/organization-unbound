I am an author and journalist based in Philadelphia, writing about the global economy, social movements, Latin American affairs, militarism, domestic politics, and the environment.

I am an editorial board member at [_Dissent_](http://dissentmagazine.org/), a contributing editor at [_Yes! Magazine_](http://www.yesmagazine.org/), and a senior analyst with [Foreign Policy In Focus](http://www.fpif.org/), a network of foreign policy experts. I also serve as a monthly columnist for the Oxford, UK-based _[New Internationalist](http://www.newint.org/)_ magazine.

I am currently co-authoring a book about the evolution of political nonviolence with my brother [Paul Engler](https://organizationunbound.org/paul-engler/), with whom I write a monthly “[Beautiful Trouble](http://beautifultrouble.org/)” column at [Waging Nonviolence](http://wagingnonviolence.org/).

An archive of my work is available at [DemocracyUprising.com](http://www.democracyuprising.com/) and I can be reached at engler(at)democracyuprising.com.
