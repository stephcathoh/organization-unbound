![gioel-photo-cut](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gioel-photo-cut-292x300.jpg)I am an intercultural explorer.

I work to make youth's experience and voice part of international development logics. I am passionate about exploring innovative ways to improve cross-cultural and cross-sector collaboration.

As the director of research at [Recrear](http://recrearinternational.org/), I prioritize action research projects in the belief that research should be fun, engaging, and transformative.

I am currently carrying out field work in Medellin, Colombia, as part of my PhD program at the [Institute of Development Studies](http://www.ids.ac.uk/) at the University of Sussex, UK. Through a case study of Colombian youth organizations, my research project explores how different funding models affect organizational culture as well as the quality of social organizations’ internal and external relationships.
