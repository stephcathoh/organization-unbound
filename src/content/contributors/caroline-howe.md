[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CarolineHoweheadshot.jpg "CarolineHowe")](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CarolineHoweheadshot.jpg)I explore how to get more people excited about sustainability, through education, new technology, financial tools, and community engagement. I'm particularly passionate about engaging young people in developing community-based solutions to environmental challenges. This has taken me to five continents, working with my start-up, [Loop Solutions](http://sites.google.com/site/loopsolutionsindia/), as well as with NGOs, youth groups, companies, UN agencies, and a ton of fantastic youth leaders.
