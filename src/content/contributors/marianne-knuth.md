[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MarianneKnuth-300x260.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MarianneKnuth.jpg)I am a woman with roots on two continents, Africa and Europe. I am passionate about supporting people in coming together in more authentic and life-affirming ways than what is the norm in most of our dominant systems.

I am the co-founder of [Kufunda Learning Village,](http://www.kufunda.org/) a centre dedicated to working with rural Zimbabweans as they discover their wealth and wisdom, for themselves, but also for people everywhere.

My journey and my passion is around learning to follow my own inner voice of wisdom, and in that finding  joy and flow. I look forward to many more women rising to their power, especially in Zimbabwe, to help shift this beautiful country out of its stuck and painful place. Read more about my journey on my [blog](http://dancinguniverse.net/) Dancing with the Universe.
