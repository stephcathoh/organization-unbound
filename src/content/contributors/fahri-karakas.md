[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Fahrithumb-300x247.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Fahrithumb.jpg)I am a Lecturer in Business and Leadership at Norwich Business School at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in London. Prior to that, I worked at Open University Business School as a Research Fellow in International Management Practice, Education, and Learning. I have a PhD from McGill University, Canada, where I wrote a doctoral thesis on benevolent leadership.

My research aims to build new ways of understanding how we can nurture the human spirit and build a collective sense of creativity and vitality in organizations. My research interests include spirituality at work, benevolent leadership, positive management education, creativity, design thinking, and social innovation. I am a member of the positive organizational scholarship (POS) network based at the University of Michigan, where we aim to understand, explain, and create the best of the human condition in organizations.

I am originally from Turkey, where I completed my undergraduate (Koc) and MBA (Bogazici) studies.
