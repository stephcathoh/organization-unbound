After a stint in an engineering college and a couple of internships, I've found my calling as a writer and an entrepreneur. Based in Mumbai (India), I'm building [Hammer & Mop](http://hammerandmop.com/), a premium cleaning services company focused on providing beneficial employment to the underprivileged and delivering remarkable service to our clients.

I also curate [Frankaffe](http://frankaffe.com/), a group blog where I write with my co-authors. Frankaffe believes in freedom, love and the vast scope of design. I'm a contributing author on [Under30CEO.com](http://under30ceo.com/) and a published poet. It is my aim to address key workforce issues in India and create brilliant organizations that deliver value to all parties involved.

I enjoy having conversations that help expand perspectives. I'm in love with efficiency and animals.
