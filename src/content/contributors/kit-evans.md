[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/KitEvans.jpg "Kit Evans")](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/KitEvans.jpg)I am a third year Master of Divinity candidate at the [Pacific School of Religion](http://www.psr.edu/) in Berkeley, California. My concentration is Women's Studies in Religion and Peace and Conflict Studies. Over the last 14 years I have used my education, teachings on nonviolence, travels, personal experiences, and relationship with God as a teacher and motivational speaker.  I hope to continue to assist women and young people working to heal from violence, abuse, and self esteem issues.

You can read more about my experience on my [blog](http://kitevans.blogspot.com/). And I can be reached at evans.kit(at)gmail.com.
