![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Richard-Bartlett.png)I am a software developer, activist, and open source hardware hacker.

I am one of the co-founders of [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org), an open source software for consensus decision-making, built by a worker-owned cooperative in New Zealand. We believe that more groups practicing effective, inclusive decision-making can change organisational dynamics at a global scale. Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.

I host [training workshops](https://blog.loomio.org/2017/03/13/were-coming-to-the-us-for-a-community-organising-workshop-tour/) with organisations that want to be more collaborative and less hierarchical. I believe the most effective way to change a team culture is through gentle sustained pressure, so I also provide coaching services to people that want a buddy to check in with regularly.
