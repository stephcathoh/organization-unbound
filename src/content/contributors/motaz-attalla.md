I am an education activist and comedian based in Cairo, Egypt. I have been fortunate to travel to many parts of the world, where my experiences and the people I have met have led me to seek a deeper understanding of the systemic roots of what is called ‘underdevelopment’.

In addition to my work exploring alternatives to schooling, I have recently been focused on food and farming, and on supporting responsible enterprise and simple everyday processes that can help anchor healthier, happier ways of living.

I'm passionate about people and about the stories that they tell, about what matters to them, theirs dreams and also their disappointments. It is precisely those stories that drive my work. I am now at a point in my life where I am trying to bring my work into more alignment with my own story, which is proving a lot harder and a lot more exciting than what I had expected.
