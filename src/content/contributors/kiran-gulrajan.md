![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/KiranGulrajani-300x200.jpg)As the founder of [CoEvolve](http://www.coevolve.in/Home.html), I enable facilitators and coach business leaders across a wide range of industries in India and some abroad. The heart is evoked and the spirit and creativity in people and organizations awakened through our signature programs- Tao of Facilitation (for the general public), Co-creative Leadership (for businesses) plus Co-evolutionary Coaching.

An ecology of approximately 100 facilitators has organically developed and, in turn, shaped me. The essence of co-evolution is to see how giving is receiving, teaching is learning and leading is following. Learning to look at life inside-out, upside-down and backside-front to contact truth and love.

I am deeply inspired by Lao Tsu, Ramana Maharshi, J. Krishnamurti, Byron Katie and many others as I seek to integrate the best of eastern and western wisdom into my work.

I enjoy connecting, enabling and co-creating with emerging communities like [Learning Societies](http://www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/ls_discussion.html), [Shikshantar](http://www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/), [Walk Out Walk On](http://www.walkoutwalkon.net/), and [ChittaSangha- The Consciousness Collaborative](www.ChittaSangha.org ).

I enjoy sharing and discovering the subtle textures of reality through my [writing](http://coevolvewithkiran.wordpress.com/).
