From working with a spirulina farm in Burkina Faso to the [Rooftop Gardens Project](http://rooftopgardens.ca) in Montreal and summer camp in Estonia, I am always looking for ways to integrate my passions for social and environmental change with the joy I take in playing music, being outside, being with friends and eating.

I currently work in Victoria, BC for the [Victoria Immigrant and Refugee Centre Society (VIRCS)](http://www.vircs.bc.ca/) helping immigrant and refugee children and youth to succeed in Canada using the the arts as well as social and academic programming. I spend most of my days scrambling to meet the daily demands of non-profit life and occasionally getting to examine why and how I try to create change.
