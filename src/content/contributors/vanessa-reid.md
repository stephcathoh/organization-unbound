I am a seeker, systems thinker, yoga practitioner, social innovator and writer with a masters in architecture from McGill University.  I was the executive publisher of the award-winning Canadian yoga publication [_ascent_ magazine](http://www.ascentmagazine.com/) and executive director of [Santropol Roulant](http://www.santropolroulant.org/), a non-profit founded by young people that uses innovative approaches to food, relationships, and sustainability as a catalyst for social change.

I am very much in the questions of how we collectively evolve and transform our institutions, physical environments, paradigms – and how to access deeper levels of intelligence – to be more deeply aligned with life.

I am currently living in Jerusalem and co-founding the Living Wholeness Institute which works to support emergent social movements and systemic transformation initiatives across the globe. I am working in the Middle East, Europe and North America collaborating with organizations, communities, movements and leaders to help hospice old systems and seed and support new ways forward. I am a steward of the translocal learning network the [Berkana Exchange](http://www.berkana.org/) and founder of the [Conscious Kitchen](http://www.venuskitchen.blogspot.com/) and the Studio of the Extraordinary.

You can read more of my work on my blog [Jerusalem Journals](http://jerusalemjournals.posterous.com/#%21/).
