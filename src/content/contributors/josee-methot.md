I like to work on issues relating to food, water, ecosystem services, and ecological economics.

I am deeply curious about how people can work together to improve this big old world of ours. I believe that positive social and ecological change hinges on our ability to find better ways of working and living together. For this reason, I tend to geek out on questions of social process – i.e., not just _what_ is done, but _how_. Over the last two years, I coordinated a sustainability initiative at McGill University called [Vision 2020](http://www.mcgill.ca/sustainability/about/vision-2020), and immersed myself in the world of process design, strategy, and facilitation. McGill now has its first Sustainability Strategy, and I have an appetite to tinker with more systems.

After four years in Montreal, I’m now in the process of moving back to Western Canada. Mountains here I come!
