[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/profile1-292x300.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/profile1.jpg)I am a doctor working in northern Canada, interested in how people's social conditions shape their experience of health.

I am currently an organiser with the [People's Health Movement Canada](http://www.phmovement.org/en/about).  I have worked in community organisations and social movements dealing with migrant rights, HIV/AIDS and poverty both in Canada and abroad. I also write, run, bike and swing dance.
