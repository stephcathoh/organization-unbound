[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cameronthumb.jpg "Cameron Stiff")](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cameronthumb.jpg)I am a freelance organizer with an interest in systems-based approaches to sustainability – integrating economic, social, and environmental issues to devise holistic solutions.

I've helped get a number of initiatives off the ground, including the [Energy Action Coalition](http://energyactioncoalition.org/), [Challenge Your World](http://challengeyourworld.com/), [Greening Duluth](http://www.maisondelamitie.ca/english/greening.html) (which is still very ground level) and various urban agriculture and food systems projects at Concordia University. I'm currently working on [Dialogue Duluth](http://dialogueonduluth.org/)\- a program that supports the development of dialogue skills amongst young changemakers in Montreal.[](http://www.syc-cjs.org/)
