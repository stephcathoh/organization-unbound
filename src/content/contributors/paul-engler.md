I am an activist, community organizer, and therapist.

I'm also founding director of the Center For the Working Poor and Burning Bush Community in Los Angeles- an inter-faith intentional community based off of the Catholic Worker movement and New Monasticism, which is committed to strategic non-violent social change.

I am writing a book with my brother [Mark Engler](https://organizationunbound.org/mark-engler/) about the evolution of political nonviolence. We also write a monthly “[Beautiful Trouble](http://beautifultrouble.org/)” column together at [Waging Nonviolence](http://wagingnonviolence.org/).

I can be reached at penglerpce97(at)yahoo.com.
