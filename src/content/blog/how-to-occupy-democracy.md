Our [Taking the Revolution Forward](https://organizationunbound.org/dialogues/taking-the-r-forward/) series continues this week with [Baijayanta Mukhopadhyay's](https://organizationunbound.org/baijayanta-mukhopadhyay/) very personal, poetic, and eclectic essay "How to Occupy Democracy." He starts by describing his experiences of revolutionary urges in Spain, India, and the U.S., which then become a doorway for deeper inquiry into the promises and puzzlements of the stirrings in his own home country of Canada. Visit his essay by clicking on the photo below.
