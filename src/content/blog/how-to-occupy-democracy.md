description: "When the civil rights movement abandoned its focus on nurturing personal, individual relationships and instead resorted to broad principles and detached theorising, it lost its power. It became coopted, removed from the people who otherwise held it accountable with the gentle discipline that is required in being true and kind to one’s friends.I suspect that this aspect is where grand nation-building projects, based on the most beautiful of ideals, stumble."

Our [Taking the Revolution Forward](https://organizationunbound.org/dialogues/taking-the-r-forward/) series continues this week with [Baijayanta Mukhopadhyay's](https://organizationunbound.org/baijayanta-mukhopadhyay/) very personal, poetic, and eclectic essay "How to Occupy Democracy." He starts by describing his experiences of revolutionary urges in Spain, India, and the U.S., which then become a doorway for deeper inquiry into the promises and puzzlements of the stirrings in his own home country of Canada. Visit his essay by clicking on the photo below.
