At the top of our minds these days is the question of how to financially sustain Organization Unbound so that it can grow into the community of practice it is yearning to be, with a deeper and wider impact across the globe. We've been exploring this question with many people over the past year. Out of these conversations has emerged an exciting vision- to crowd-sustain Organization Unbound so that the financial support it receives is gently distributed across many people and organizations, from all walks of life and social change spaces. And that those who see themselves as part of Organization Unbound, or feel a strong affinity to it, make up the core of this circle of sustained support. Next week we will be launching the first of our experiments in this direction. Stay tuned by following us on facebook and twitter.
