_We met Sushrut last year at a workshop we gave in Mumbai a few months after he launched his new cleaning business __[Hammer & Mop](http://hammerandmop.com/blog/about/)__. Recently he re-connected to see if we could carve out some thinking time with him. He was feeling that the expressive change themes he had been introduced to in the workshop were becoming increasingly relevant and wanted to think about how to put them into practice._ 

_Given Tolu's years of experience in the cleaning industry and passion for_ __cultivating an expressive spirit at __[Zenith Cleaners](http://zenithcleaners.com/)__, we thought it would be neat to bring him into the conversation. And we're happy we did._  __He shared some amazing stories of how he is challenging the__ __norms of the cleaning industry and __how an expressive approach, in even the most mundane spaces, can be a revolutionary act._____ 

_Enjoy!_
