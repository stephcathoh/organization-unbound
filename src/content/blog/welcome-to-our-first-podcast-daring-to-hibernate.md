_A couple of months ago I received an intriguing note in my inbox from [The Berkana Institute](http://www.berkana.org/). For those of you who aren't familiar with Berkana, you might know one of it's founders [Meg Wheatley](http://www.margaretwheatley.com/), a well-known author who writes about applying living systems theory to organizations and communities._

_The note from Berkana begins by announcing that the organization is celebrating it's 20th anniversary, so I naturally expected to read on that they were planning a big party or some other kind of commemorative activity. Instead, I learned that they would be marking this occasion in quite an unconventional way, by retreating into a phase of hibernation for an indefinite period of time._

_We were quite intrigued with this unorthodox organizational decision and so got in touch with_ _[Aerin Dunford](https://organizationunbound.org/aerin-dunford/), a core member of the Berkana team, to learn more._

UPDATE: In 2015, after Berkana emerged from hibernation, we recorded a [follow-up podcast](https://organizationunbound.org/expressive-change/emerging-from-hibernation/) with Aerin to find out how things were going.
