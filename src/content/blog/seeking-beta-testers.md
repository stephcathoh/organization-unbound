[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IloveBeta.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IloveBeta.jpg)Over the past several months, we've started to see our vision for a self-guided curriculum on expressive change come to life. A number of people have volunteered to beta-test the pieces we've developed so far, and the testimonials have been so encouraging that we've decided to expand our pool of beta-testers to more organizations and countries.

Here is a [description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dksW1j3oHWMGaccoC1bhw7WxTfvu70dxLm5b5GgEce0/edit) of what we envision the self-guided curriculum becoming. The pieces that we're currently beta-testing are the "Conversation Deepeners". If you are intrigued and think you might want to try one out in your organization or social movement, let us know. Email Tana at tana@organizationunbound.org.
