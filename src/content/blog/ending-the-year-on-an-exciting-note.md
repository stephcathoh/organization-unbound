Greetings folks!

[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/98Endofyear2012.jpg "Photo by Tochis at Flickr.com")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tochis/3064550266/sizes/z/in/set-72157610278626762/)You might have noticed that we've been a little less talkative at Organization Unbound lately. It's not because we're scared speechless that the world is about to end, but because we've been hard at work on a new project: A self-guided curriculum to deepen and spread the practice of expressive change.

It will be both an introduction and practical guide for anyone who wants to gently nudge their organizations in a more [expressive](https://organizationunbound.org/about-2/) direction. It is for people who are asking themselves: "What type of impact might we have if we took the inner lives of our organizations more seriously as leverage points for social change?"

We have started to beta-test the first three sessions with organizations in Cape Town and Montreal and are actively seeking to expand the pool of beta-testers. If you're interested, we'd love to hear from you! You can contact Tana at tana@organizationunbound.org.

We've also just finished a working paper that expands on the [Social Innovation from the Inside Out](https://organizationunbound.org/expressive-change/social-innovation-from-the-inside-out/) talk that Warren gave at University of Cape Town earlier in the year. If you'd like to read it, drop us a line and we'll send you a copy.

Have a restful and joyful holiday, Tana, Warren & Jonathan
