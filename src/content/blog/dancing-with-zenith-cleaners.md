[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DancewithZeniththumb.jpg "Photo by istolethetv at Flickr.com")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/istolethetv/2858268738/in/photostream/)I was reading through the Zenith Cleaners blog recently and came across a reflection written by our friend Tolu Ilesanmi titledÂ [Invitation to the dance](http://blog.zenithcleaners.com/2011/02/invitation-to-dance.html). In it he describes the kind of reciprocal relationship he works hard to create with his staff, clients and suppliers.

I thought I would share it here given how strongly it connects to [the giving field](https://organizationunbound.org/expressive-change/thegivingfield/ "The giving field"), a concept that is very much at the core of our Organization Unbound explorations.

I also like it because it includes one of my favourite quotes : )
