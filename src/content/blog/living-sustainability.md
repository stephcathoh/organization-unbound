Jonathan's approach to environmental advocacy has helped spark some dramatic sustainability initiatives at McGill University.

We thought you'd enjoy listening to a [TedxTalk](http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxMcGill-Jonathan-Glencross) that he gave a few months ago to an audience of 700 in which he describes the core  principles that are guiding the institutional change processes that he and a growing number of students, faculty and staff members have embarked on.

He speaks eloquently about approaching sustainability not just as a series of outcomes to achieve but as a lived experience to seed and cultivate in every aspect of university life, starting with the change initiative itself. It's a great presentation from one of our favorite humans. Check it out.
