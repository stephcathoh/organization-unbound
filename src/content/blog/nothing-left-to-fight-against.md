In [![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NothingLeftToFight1.jpg "Photo by Keith Bacongco at Flickr.com")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kitoy/2295899980/in/photostream/)this short reflection titled "Nothing to Fight Against", Zenkei Blanche Hartman, a political activist-turned-Zen monk, describes the turmoil she felt when she confronted the disconnect between her deepest values and her experience of activism.
