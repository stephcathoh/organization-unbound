[![Photo found at Bensound.com](/99DancingtheTalk.jpg "Bensound")](http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/groovy-hip-hop)In this podcast, we speak to [Kiran Gulrajani](https://organizationunbound.org/kiran-gulrajani/), who challenges us to take a lighter and more exploratory approach to living out our values in our work.

We had the pleasure of hosting him and his [CoEvolve](http://www.coevolve.in/Home.html) colleague Rohit Sasvehalli at our home during their recent visit to South Africa. Our intention was to record this podcast during their stay, but we found ourselves distracted by more exciting endeavours like scenic drives up the coast and whale watching.  So a couple of weeks later I caught up with Kiran via Skype at a cafe in Northeast India.
