_We're excited to introduce you to our newest Organization Unbound contributor and great friend,_ _[Tolu Ilesanmi](https://organizationunbound.org/tolulope-ilesanmi/). For many years Tolu has inspired us with his way of infusing love and spirit into every space he enters: the community, the classroom, his family, his [businesses](https://organizationunbound.org/expressive-change/zenith-cleaners/)._ _Now he is bringing that same spark to social movement work in his birth country, Nigeria._

_In this contribution to the [Taking the Revolution Forward](https://organizationunbound.org/dialogues/taking-the-r-forward/) collection,_ _he reflects on what has pulled him in this new direction. Click on the photo below to read his reflection._
