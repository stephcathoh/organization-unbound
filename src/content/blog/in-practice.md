If you are looking for ways to introduce the concept and practice of expressive change into your organization, check out the “conversation deepeners” below (permanently housed [here](organizationunbound.org/in-practice/)). They are the first in [a collection of self-guided learning materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dksW1j3oHWMGaccoC1bhw7WxTfvu70dxLm5b5GgEce0/edit?usp=sharing) that we’re developing.

The ideas and practices they contain spring from a global community of practice of organizations asking themselves: _What type of impact might we have if we took the inner lives of our organizations more seriously as leverage points for social change?_

They are designed for a small group of people within the same organization to do together and can be done in any order.

The materials are free to share and adapt. For editable versions, email tana(at)organizationunbound.org.
