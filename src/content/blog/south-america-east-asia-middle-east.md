As many of you know, over the last few months we've been collecting interviews from around the world for a short film we're making on expressive change. Although we are in the process of wrapping up the crowd-sourcing phase of the project, we are keeping the door open for interviews from South America, East Asia, and the Middle East in hopes that we can capture a few more experiences from these regions of the world. We are looking for people who have had experiences working with social purpose organizations or movements that are in many ways embodying the change they are seeking to create in the world. This [2-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dksW1j3oHWMGaccoC1bhw7WxTfvu70dxLm5b5GgEce0/edit?usp=sharing) describes the theme in more detail, as well as the larger project it will be feeding into.

If you or someone you know might be keen to contribute, please drop us a line and we'll send  you the interview guide (tana@organizationunbound.org). All you need is a smartphone or some other high-resolution recording device and a friend or colleague to interview you.

Thanks to all who have contributed your experiences thus far!

Tana
