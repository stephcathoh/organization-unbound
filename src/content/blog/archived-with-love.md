This website is a static archive of Organization Unbound (2010-2020), a decade-long global inquiry into the relationship between the inner life of social purpose organizations and their outer work in the world. We hope you are enlivened by the writings, videos, and self-guided workshops it contains. Much of the core content will be migrated to the Institute for Collective Wellbeing, located in their Little Library and throughout their website (tagged as 'Organization Unbound').
Although Organization Unbound is no longer an active community of practice, the learning continues to evolve in exciting new forms:

A book in the making

The creation of Org School, in partnership with the Institute for Collective Wellbeing

An organizational wellbeing community of practice consisting of global changemakers from Ghana, Scotland, Spain, France, the Netherlands, South Africa, and the United States, from organizations including, The Wellbeing Project, Nkum Associates, and the Institute for Collective Wellbeing.

We are grateful that our many years of learning and research will be preserved and expanded upon. If you have questions or ideas you'd like to explore, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out:
