description: "Any categorization of outside and inside, enemy and friend, good and bad is an illusion of the mind. I remember a quotation by the first prime minister of the transitional government after the 1979 revolution in Iran, who said, “The Shah (king) is not gone, because there is still a little Shah living within each one of us”. His message was that the spirit of monarchy and dictatorship is not gone by the departure or execution of the monarch, but that it could continue in every meeting, every election, every institution, every family and so on."

Next in our collection of [Taking the Revolution Forward]( /dialogues/taking-the-r-forward/) contributors is [Aydin Yassemi](/aydin-yassemi/), who explores the beauty revolutions are capable of manifesting, the mirages they can produce, and the possibilities he sees for their transformation. The insights he shares are rooted in his experience of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 as a young boy, his relationships with former freedom fighters, and the eclectic mix of organizational and community development projects he has been involved in over the years. Click on the photo below to read his reflections.
