Next in our collection of [Taking the Revolution Forward]( https://organizationunbound.org/dialogues/taking-the-r-forward/) contributors is [Aydin Yassemi](https://organizationunbound.org/aydin-yassemi/), who explores the beauty revolutions are capable of manifesting, the mirages they can produce, and the possibilities he sees for their transformation. The insights he shares are rooted in his experience of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 as a young boy, his relationships with former freedom fighters, and the eclectic mix of organizational and community development projects he has been involved in over the years. Click on the photo below to read his reflections.
