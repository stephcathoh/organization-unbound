Webinar offering](https://video.webcasts.com/events/pmny001/viewer/index.jsp?eventid=47672). We're excited to have Marlon Parker, founder of the Cape Town-based organization [RLabs](http://www.rlabs.org/), join us to talk about his organization's experience.

The webinar is for people at nonprofit organizations, foundations, and other social purpose groups who want to create internal processes that will help to build a deep, long-lasting capacity for innovative thought and action. Participants will have an opportunity to pose questions in the last 20 or so minutes of the webinar.

Given that the price is beyond what most organizations in our network can afford, SSIR has given us 20 complimentary seats to distribute. Please send me an email at tana@organizationunbound.org if you are a member of a social change organization that would otherwise not be able to participate. We will be distributing the complimentary tickets on a first-come-first-serve basis.
