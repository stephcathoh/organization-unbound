![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/163GivingFieldOU6.jpg)One of the many Organization Unbound ideas that I love is [The Giving Field](https://organizationunbound.org/expressive-change/thegivingfield/), where giving is not a unidirectional transaction but a field in which all participate, where there is no longer a distinction between giver and receiver, where everyone contributes and benefits continuously. I have experienced the generative nature of the giving field in my own life and work in often surprising ways, and I wonder what might happen if those of us within Organization Unbound’s orbit became more intentional about activating a giving field. This is both a reflection and an invitation.

Organization Unbound is entering a phase where it is being called to do more and increase its impact: accompanying more people and organizations as they experiment with the practice of expressive change, convening more global learning exchanges, and creating more learning materials. This will require resources. Organization Unbound can no longer sustain itself on volunteer hours and passion alone.

I see this need for more resources as an exciting opportunity to experiment with the giving field, particularly in the realm of finances, an area that many in the social purpose world tend to shy away from. And for good reason. Despite the fact that money is one of the primary ways humans store and measure value, we don’t have the best track record when it comes to using it in a way that contributes to a healthier and more just world. But money itself is not the culprit. Our inner state is the culprit. How money manifests is a reflection of our collective consciousness.

I wonder what we might learn from inquiring appreciatively into our experience with money? For example, I have noticed that my connection to something I care about often expands when I contribute to it financially. And why is this? One of the ways I express my love for something or someone and desire for them to thrive is to give to them. Since money is one of the ways my time is valued, for me giving financially can be an act of love, a way of giving myself to another.

How can we participate in giving and receiving in a way that enables Organization Unbound, and by extension all of us, to thrive even more in the years ahead? I’m excited to see what will emerge from this inquiry. In the meantime, here are a few of my own thoughts on what this might look and feel like in practice:

**Unbounded amounts-** I cannot begin to measure the impact that Organization Unbound has had on me personally and on my social enterprise [Zenith Cleaning](http://zenithcleaners.com/). Our story is incomplete without Organization Unbound. It has helped me articulate the essence of what we are trying to do and has greatly influenced the overall direction we’ve taken as an organization. How do I put a figure to something so non-quantifiable? My view is that if you have the means, it is better to give an amount that feels too low than to not give at all. What I have done is to start with a figure that pops up in my mind, that I feel comfortable with. But rather than seeing it as indicative of the actual value of the relationship, I see it as a symbol of the immeasurable value of the relationship.

**Unbounded terms-** We should feel free to change the level, type and frequency of our contributions at any time and for any reason. The process of re-evaluating our giving is itself a gift, even if it results in a decision to completely withdraw. Because if at any point we feel stressed in our giving relationship with Organization Unbound, that weakens the giving field, even if no one is aware of this. The field is aware. On the flip side, a re-evaluation might result in completely rethinking how we contribute, leading to new creative avenues of contribution.

**Sharing-** Sharing reports of inflows and outflows strengthens the field. Sharing how we are experiencing this adventure strengthens the field. Practicing on-going [inscaping](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/social_innovation_from_the_inside_out) strengthens the field. It would also be great to find a way to harvest and make visible what we’re learning so that it can be shared more broadly.

These ideas are far from exhaustive. The giving field has an intelligence of its own. It is strengthened by every thought, word or act that is a gift, including the act of receiving. And it is weakened by any thought, word or act that deprives. Regardless of how strong the field becomes, I do not think we can avoid a weakening from time to time. When we notice a weakening, we strengthen it again through our gifts.

Contributing as part of a larger giving field is an opportunity to transform how we relate to money- to infuse it with a relational, creative, and restorative quality. It is the same spirit that prompts us at Zenith Cleaning to take cleaning deeper, to see and relate to cleaning as it truly _is_ rather than the chore it has been portrayed to be. This spirit of inquiry can apply anywhere. How do we go beyond the surface of whatever it is we do, even what may seem purely transactional, to explore its deeper and richer dimensions?

Thank you for taking time to read this reflection. If you have thoughts to share, please post them in the comment section below.
