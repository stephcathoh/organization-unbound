The conversations we've had in Toronto over the past week have been incredibly inspiring and insightful. They have affirmed that the themes we've been exploring have a far-reaching resonance and that there is considerable interest in continuing to explore them in deeper and more practical ways.

The feedback that we got from folks at the presentation was that they want more of a focus on concrete practices, more sustained dialogue and experimentation across and within organizations, and more examples and resources to dig into.

We had a few really insightful conversations about what this kind of extended action-based learning might look like in practice and over the next little while we're going to be doing a lot more brainstorming. Let us know if you have any ideas or if you'd like to brainstorm with us.
