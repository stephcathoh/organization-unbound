_\* Now available in Spanish & French subtitles\*_

The short film on expressive change that we've been working on over the last year and a half is finally finished! A big thanks goes out to the 81 people who submitted interviews, as well as to [Go Trolley Films](http://www.gotrolley.com/) and Dave Jackson Animation for helping to bring it to life.

The 16-minute film is intended as a conversation starter for staff, volunteers, board members, and funders of social purpose organisations. Through a compilation of crowd-sourced interviews, it challenges us to pay closer attention to the link between an organisation's social purpose and how that purpose is lived inside the organization on a daily basis. 

If you'd like to host a film screening & dialogue in your organization or at an event, visit [this page](https://organizationunbound.org/in-practice/) for tips, a list of guiding questions, and download links. You will also find a series of free self-guided learning sessions designed to help people working in the same organization explore expressive change in practice..
