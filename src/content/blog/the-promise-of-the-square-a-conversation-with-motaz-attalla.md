description: "Warren: Can you take us back a bit to how you experienced the early days of Tahrir Square?

Motaz: There was this sense of rediscovering pure community- with all its good and bad. Knowing what it means to receive gifts and give gifts, to receive care and give care between absolute strangers and with a totally open heart. And feeling just a sweetness of courage. And to know that we don’t have to worry about the consequences of stepping out- not because things won’t turn out bad but because there is a lot of support for the act of bravery itself. And to me that’s the glue of society. Feeling like people are for you and you are for people."

**_[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TRFSandGrey.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/dialogues/taking-the-r-forward/)Our first Taking the Revolution Forward conversation is with [Motaz Attalla](https://organizationunbound.org/motaz-attalla/), who we met last year at an [unconference](https://organizationunbound.org/expressive-change/the-un-conference/) in India on alternative education. He had a large group of us riveted as he talked about his experiences in Tahrir Square during the early days of the Egyptian revolution, and his description of "the life of the square" was so compelling and hopeful that it inspired us to create this series of reflections. Click on the photo below to read an edited version of our conversation. We hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed having it._**
