**_[![](https://organizationunbound.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TRFSandGrey.jpg)](https://organizationunbound.org/dialogues/taking-the-r-forward/)Our first Taking the Revolution Forward conversation is with [Motaz Attalla](https://organizationunbound.org/motaz-attalla/), who we met last year at an [unconference](https://organizationunbound.org/expressive-change/the-un-conference/) in India on alternative education. He had a large group of us riveted as he talked about his experiences in Tahrir Square during the early days of the Egyptian revolution, and his description of "the life of the square" was so compelling and hopeful that it inspired us to create this series of reflections. Click on the photo below to read an edited version of our conversation. We hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed having it._**
